<sub><i>none of these feature work for now, its just the start of a project which I just had to start, but which im not actively working on.</i></sub>

PokerSense - A website helping in understanding poker, maybe...
- and automaticaly solving who wins with certain cards, etc
- yes this exists already but i want to do it for myself, see how hard it is, and have it exactly the way that i want, maybe make it even better that way...
